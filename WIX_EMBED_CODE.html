<iframe
  src="https://book.avatarimaging.com.au/book"
  width="100%"
  height="900px"
  frameborder="0"
  style="border: none; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); background: white;"
  title="Avatar Imaging - Book an Appointment"
  loading="lazy"
></iframe>

<!--
  ALTERNATIVE: Full Page Link

  If you prefer to send users to a dedicated booking page instead of embedding:
  Simply link to: https://book.avatarimaging.com.au/book

  Example button in Wix:
  <a href="https://book.avatarimaging.com.au/book" target="_blank">
    Book an Appointment
  </a>
-->

  STYLING TIPS:

  1. Container padding: Add padding around the iframe in Wix for better spacing
  2. Mobile view: The booking form is mobile responsive, test on different screen sizes
  3. Height adjustment: If form content is cut off, increase height to 1000px or 1100px
  4. Background: The iframe has a white background, ensure your Wix page complements it

  CUSTOMIZATION:

  To match your exact Wix theme colors, we can build a custom Wix Velo integration.
  This would require:
  - Wix Velo app development
  - API integration with your CRM
  - Custom styling to match your theme perfectly

  For now, the iframe approach gets you up and running immediately!
